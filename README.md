📘 Overview
This project is divided into three main folders:
🧠 backend/ – Contains all backend logic and API routes.
💻 frontend/ – Contains the React-based user interface.
⚙️ elec/ – Contains the C library source code (.c, .dll, .exe, etc.) used for low-level operations.

🚀 Project Setup
🔹 1. Install Dependencies
          Run the following command in each folder (backend and frontend):
          npm install
🔹 2. Run Servers
          Both frontend and backend run on different ports:
          Backend: localhost:3002
          Frontend: localhost:3000

          🧠 Run Order
          Start the backend server first
             cd backend
             npm start
          Then start the frontend server
             cd frontend
             npm start

🔗 Frontend–Backend Communication

The frontend communicates with the backend using API calls like:
axios.post("http://65.2.127.87:3002//FunctionName", {
  varName: "xyz"
});
